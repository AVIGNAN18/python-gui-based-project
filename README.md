# python-gui-based-project

Actually it is a GUI application form. I have used radio widget, level, entry widget etc. features provided by tkinter(toolkit interface) module. First, create a window object of Tk() class. Atlast , I have added password entry field which internally verify with the help of elif condition, if password field matched with re-enter password field then all the data stored into the database SQL.
